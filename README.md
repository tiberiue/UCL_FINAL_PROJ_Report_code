# UCL_FINAL_PROJ_Report_code
Here all the code and files utilised up to the submission of the report will be store.

This read me file is found within the "main" branch of the repository, for some reason all of the files were uploaded to a different branch named Tiberiu, to view said files switch to that other branch.

In said branch all of the files found bar the folder named top_tagging were utilised for W-boson tagging, the top tagging files were separated into a different folder for simplicity but there will likely be a lot of overlap as the top tagging files are just slightly alterated versions of the W boson tagging ones.
